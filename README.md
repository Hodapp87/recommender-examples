Start from: [Recommender Systems.ipynb](./Recommender%20Systems.ipynb)

There is also an exported copy of the part 1 notebook at:
<https://hodapple.com/blag/posts/2018-04-08-recommender-systems-1/>

This is a tutorial on [recommender
systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system).  It is
written in the form of a Jupyter notebook with a literate program -
explanation and derivation is given interspersed with an
implementation in Python which applies the math and algorithms to the
task of movie recommendations (based on the [MovieLens
20M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/) dataset).

This tutorial covers only collaborative filtering, but future parts
are planned which cover other topics within recommender systems.
